# Regulated AI Deployment Kit

Synthetic embedded-finance deployment-readiness case study for regulated AI systems.

This repository is not a generic agent demo. It is structured to show the full loop from workflow mapping to measurable multi-agent behavior, traces, deterministic-first evals, redacted evidence, regression creation, and a launch/no-launch recommendation.

## Public-Safety Stance

- Synthetic cases, policies, identifiers, risk bands, and partner configurations only.
- No real customer data, production thresholds, proprietary workflows, SAR-adjacent examples, or real fraud controls.
- Public claims must be backed by generated traces, eval reports, redacted evidence packs, or deployment docs.
- Local raw traces and private project context are excluded from version control by default.

## Architecture Target

```text
Synthetic case
  -> IntakeNormalizer
  -> OrchestratorAgent
  -> Specialist agent
  -> Synthetic tools and policies
  -> EvaluatorNode
  -> HumanApprovalNode when required
  -> FinalResponseComposer
  -> Trace and eval artifacts
  -> Redacted evidence
  -> Eval card and pilot recommendation
```

## Starter Layout

- `PLAN_v3_openai_tdl_fde.md` contains the detailed build plan.
- `deployment/` contains the customer-deployment leadership artifacts.
- `case_studies/` contains public-safe synthetic datasets and dataset cards.
- `app/` will contain the LangGraph system under test.
- `evals/` will contain deterministic graders and eval adapters.
- `scripts/` will contain local CLIs for datasets, evals, redaction, regressions, and reports.
- `.claude/` contains Claude Code subagent and hook scaffolding.

## First Build Milestones

1. Complete deployment docs for workflow map, value case, KPI tree, acceptance criteria, and risk register.
2. Define Pydantic schemas for cases, graph state, traces, and grader results.
3. Build the Financial Links reliability workflow first.
4. Run a baseline eval with local JSON artifacts.
5. Convert at least one failure into a regression case and update the eval card.
